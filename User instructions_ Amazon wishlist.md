# Amazon wish lists

Amazon wish lists allow you to keep track of the items you wish to buy.
You can also use lists as a gift registry to share with family and
friends. Once an item on the list is purchased, this item is labeled as
such, so you won't receive multiples.

## Create a list

1. On your Amazon home page, hover over **Accounts & Lists**. 
2. In the **Your Lists** menu, click **Create a List**.

   <table><tr><td>
   <img src="images/create-list.png" alt="Create a List "width= "350" >
   </td></tr></table>

3. In the **Create a new list** dialog, name your list and click **Create
list**.

## Add items to your list

You can add items to your list from a product page.

- In the **Add to list** drop-down menu on the left of the product page,
select an existing list or create a new one.
   
   <table><tr><td>
   <img src="images/add-to-list.png" alt="Add to list" width= "200">

The item is added to the selected list.
