# Amazon wish lists

Amazon wish lists allow you to keep track of the items you wish to buy.
You can also use lists as a gift registry to share with family and
friends. Once an item on the list is purchased, this item is labeled as
such, so you won't receive multiples.

## Create a list

1. On your Amazon home page, hover over **Accounts & Lists**. 
2. In the **Your Lists** menu, click **Create a List**.

   <table><tr><td>
   <img src="Google Docs1.jpg" alt="Create a List "width= "350" >
   </td></tr></table>

3. In the **Create a new list** dialog, name your list and click **Create
list**.

## Add items to your list

You can add items to your list from a product page.

- In the **Add to list** drop-down menu on the left of the product page,
select an existing list or create a new one.
   
   <table><tr><td>
   <img src="Google Docs 2.png" alt="Add to list" width= "200">
   </td></tr></table>

The item is added to the selected list.
 
## Share your list

1. Open your list and click **Invite** or **Send list to others**.

   <table><tr><td>
   <img src="Google Docs 4.png" alt="Share list" width= "700" >
   </td></tr></table>

2. Select **VIEW ONLY** if you don't want other people to edit your list,
or **VIEW AND EDIT** if you would like others to add and remove items from
your list. 
3. Select **Copy link** or **Invite by email** to share your list.

## Manage your list
